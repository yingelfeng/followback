Python script to check who doesn't follow you back on Instagram bc I'm no one's fan

How to use:
- On Instagram under "your activity," download the HTML or JSON files for your followers/following for *all time*
- If using HTML, copy and paste everything into the .txt files provided. This will filter out timestamps as well
- If JSON, drag JSON files into the project folder
